# Caveman Help Reference

## 0. Identity

- **Role:** Reference cheat sheet for Caveman suite under `skills/workflow/caveman/`.
- **Authority:** Sub-skill of `skills/workflow/caveman/`.
- **Must not define:** Normative tier-4 standards in `core/fellowship/`.
- **Normative base:** `core/fellowship/legolas.md`, `references/anti-patterns.md`.

---

## 1. Intent

- Provide a compact operator reference for Caveman modes and sub-skills.

---

## 2. Trigger Matrix

| Scenario                                            | Decision | Action                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| User asks how to invoke Caveman modes or sub-skills | YES      | Return quick-reference command mapping             |
| User asks for deep implementation details           | NO       | Route to relevant technical skill or documentation |

---

## 3. Execution Workflow

- Identify whether user needs command list, intensity behavior, or routing help.
- Return only the relevant command set and invariants.
- Keep guidance concise and operational.

---

## 4. Output Specification

- Return Markdown command table plus required invariants.

---

## 5. Validation Gate

- [ ] Commands are accurate and current
- [ ] Guidance remains concise and direct
- [ ] Output includes key invariants

---

## 6. Anti-Triggers

- Do not provide speculative commands that are not defined.

---

## 7. Anti-Pattern Compliance

| Anti-Pattern                  | Prevention Mechanism                      |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Ambiguous command guidance    | Use explicit command-to-action mapping    |
| Overly verbose help responses | Keep output to concise reference material |

---

## 8. Versioning

- **v1.0.0** (2026-09-15): Initial caveman help sub-skill.

---

## 9. Portability Matrix

| Runtime | Status |
| ------- | ------ |
| All     | Passed |

---

## 10. Commands Reference

| Command            | Action                                           |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `caveman lite`     | Activate zero-filler complete sentences          |
| `caveman full`     | Activate default compressed style with fragments |
| `caveman ultra`    | Activate maximum compression mode                |
| `caveman off`      | Deactivate compression and restore normal tone   |
| `caveman-commit`   | Generate concise Conventional Commit message     |
| `caveman-review`   | Generate one-line review findings                |
| `caveman-compress` | Compress targeted Markdown document              |

---

## 11. Invariants

- Code blocks, commands, and paths remain untouched.
- Critical logic qualifiers (`not`, `never`, `no`) are never dropped.
- Writing standards from `references/anti-patterns.md` remain in effect.
