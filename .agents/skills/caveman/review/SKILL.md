## 2. Trigger Matrix

| Scenario                                   | Decision | Action                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| User requests concise code review findings | YES      | Emit one-line findings with line, severity, problem, and fix |
| User asks for long-form narrative review   | NO       | Route to standard review mode                                |

---

## 3. Execution Workflow

- Parse the diff or snippet for concrete issues.
- Classify each issue severity.
- Emit one finding per line in the required format.

---

## 4. Output Specification

```text
L14: style: banned word detected. Replace with direct phrasing.
L42: risk: null reference possible before check. Add guard condition.
L88: nit: long function spans multiple domains. Extract helper function.
```

---

## 5. Validation Gate

- [ ] Each finding includes line, severity, problem, and fix

| Overlong narrative reviews | Enforce one-line finding format  |
