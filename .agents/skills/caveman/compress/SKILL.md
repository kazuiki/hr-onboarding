# Caveman Document Compressor

## 0. Identity

- **Role:** Markdown documentation compression engine under `skills/workflow/caveman/`.
- **Authority:** Sub-skill of `skills/workflow/caveman/`.
- **Must not define:** Normative tier-4 standards in `core/fellowship/`.
- **Normative base:** `core/fellowship/legolas.md`, `references/anti-patterns.md`.

---

## 1. Intent

### What to Strip

- Conversational pleasantries and preambles.
- Filler words: `really`, `basically`, `actually`, `simply`, `essentially`.
- Articles where meaning remains clear: `a`, `an`, `the`.
- Hedging phrases: "it might be worth considering", "one could potentially".
- Connective padding: "furthermore", "in addition to this".

### What to Keep Verbatim

- Fenced code blocks and inline code spans.
- URLs, relative links, and anchor tags.
- Directory trees and file paths.
- Terminal commands and CLI parameters.
- Numbers, units, dates, and version identifiers.
- Markdown headers and table structures.

## 2. Trigger Matrix

| Scenario                                                           | Decision | Action                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| User requests token reduction for Markdown prose                   | YES      | Compress prose while preserving technical fidelity |
| Content is source code transformation instead of prose compression | NO       | Route to a coding-focused skill                    |

---

## 3. Execution Workflow

- Identify compressible prose spans.
- Remove filler and conversational padding while preserving meaning.
- Preserve code, paths, commands, and links exactly.

---

## 4. Output Specification

- Return compressed Markdown with structure preserved.
- Keep code fences, inline code, and link targets unchanged.

---

## 5. Validation Gate

- [ ] Technical terms and constraints remain intact
- [ ] Markdown structure remains valid
- [ ] Compression removed non-essential filler only

---

## 6. Anti-Triggers

- Do not compress when the user asks for verbatim preservation.

---

## 7. Anti-Pattern Compliance

| Anti-Pattern                 | Prevention Mechanism                                |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Dropping critical negation   | Preserve logic qualifiers like `not`, `never`, `no` |
| Breaking executable snippets | Keep code and commands verbatim                     |
